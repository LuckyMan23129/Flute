## Introduction

Flute combines hardware and software to enable sustainable operation of IoT devices. The hardware is a plug-and-play power supply and management board for Adafruit Feather format devices that provides super-capacitor charge storage and solar energy harvesting. While the software element consist of self-adaptive scheduling algorithms which integrate seamlessly with standard development environments. This combination of custom hardware and adaptive software allows Flute to ensure sustainable operation in the face of dynamic energy supply and demand.
